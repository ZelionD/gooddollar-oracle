#+title: Production TODO list

Infrastructure:
+ need description about the setup
+ make sure we have a firewall
+ internal documentation about the credentials

Things to change:
+ clear separation of errors vs warning
  errors will trigger an alert
  also, the errors captured by GCP should have color codes disabled
+ we should enable to load key from env variable, rather than

Style:
+ no need to wrap the Account address (Hex String) into a User {a: String} object in the http Req. req.message can be just an address.

Services to integrate with:
+ GCP Logging
+ GCP alerting based on error logs
   -> sent to telegram
